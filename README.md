**Weather Forecast Analysis with Python**

This Python project aims to provide users with a comprehensive tool for analyzing weather forecast data. By leveraging weather APIs, data processing techniques, statistical analysis, and visualization tools, users can gain insights into upcoming weather conditions for desired locations.

**Features:**
- **Data Processing:** Clean, preprocess, and format the retrieved data for analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculate mean temperature, humidity, precipitation probability, and other relevant metrics.
- **Visualization:** Generate visualizations (e.g., line charts, bar graphs, heatmaps) to illustrate forecast trends and patterns.
- **Historical Comparison:** Optionally, compare forecasted conditions with historical weather data for additional insights.
- **Customization:** Allow users to specify location, forecast duration, and types of weather parameters to analyze.

**Tools and Libraries:**
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- NumPy
